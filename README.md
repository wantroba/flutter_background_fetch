------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Background Fetch is a *very* simple plugin which attempts to awaken an app in the background about **every 15 minutes**, providing a short period of background running-time.  This plugin will execute your provided `callbackFn` whenever a background-fetch event occurs.

There is **no way** to increase the rate which a fetch-event occurs and this plugin sets the rate to the most frequent possible &mdash; you will **never** receive an event faster than **15 minutes**.  The operating-system will automatically throttle the rate the background-fetch events occur based upon usage patterns.  Eg: if user hasn't turned on their phone for a long period of time, fetch events will occur less frequently or if an iOS user disables background refresh they may not happen at all.

:new: Background Fetch now provides a [`scheduleTask`](https://fetch.transistorsoft.com/flutter/BackgroundFetch#scheduletask) method for scheduling arbitrary "one-shot" or periodic tasks.

### iOS
- There is **no way** to increase the rate which a fetch-event occurs and this plugin sets the rate to the most frequent possible &mdash; you will **never** receive an event faster than **15 minutes**.  The operating-system will automatically throttle the rate the background-fetch events occur based upon usage patterns.  Eg: if user hasn't turned on their phone for a long period of time, fetch events will occur less frequently.
- [`scheduleTask`](https://fetch.transistorsoft.com/flutter/BackgroundFetch#scheduletask) seems only to fire when the device is plugged into power.
- :warning: When your app is **terminated**, iOS *no longer fires events* &mdash; There is *no such thing* as **`stopOnTerminate: false`** for iOS.
- iOS can take *days* before Apple's machine-learning algorithm settles in and begins regularly firing events.  Do not sit staring at your logs waiting for an event to fire.  If your [*simulated events*](https://fetch.transistorsoft.com/flutter/debugging) work, that's all you need to know that everything is correctly configured.
- If the user doesn't open your *iOS* app for long periods of time, *iOS* will **stop firing events**.

### Android
- The Android plugin provides a [Headless](https://fetch.transistorsoft.com/flutter/BackgroundFetchConfig#enableheadless) implementation allowing you to continue handling events even after app-termination.
